# Synthetic Data Classification

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates how to generate and use **synthetic data** for training machine learning models. Synthetic data helps solve the **class imbalance problem**, improving model performance in scenarios with limited real-world data.

## 🎯 Why Synthetic Data?
- **Handles Class Imbalance:** Real-world datasets often have **more negative samples than positive ones**. Synthetic sampling balances the dataset.
- **Improves Model Generalization:** Helps the model learn better patterns without overfitting to limited real data.
- **Data Privacy:** Can be used when real data is sensitive or restricted (e.g., healthcare, finance).
- **Enables Experimentation:** Allows testing models on different distributions without real-world collection costs.

## 🌍 Real-World Applications
1. **Fraud Detection**: Banks generate synthetic fraudulent transactions to train models better.
2. **Healthcare**: Synthetic patient records help train AI while preserving privacy.
3. **Autonomous Vehicles**: Simulated environments generate synthetic sensor data for self-driving cars.
4. **Cybersecurity**: Synthetic attack data is used to improve intrusion detection systems.

## 🛠️ Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/soujanya-s-p/Synthetic-Data-Classification.git
cd Synthetic-Data-Classification
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Usage
Run the main script to generate synthetic data and visualize results:
```sh
python synthetic_data.py
```

## 📈 Methods Implemented
- **Before vs. After Synthetic Sampling** visualizations
- **SMOTE-based data augmentation**
- **Custom synthetic sample generation** (Upcoming feature: GANs, VAEs)

## 💡 Future Improvements
- ✅ **Configurable sampling techniques** (SMOTE, ADASYN, GANs, VAEs)
- ✅ **Turn this into a Python package** (`pip install synthetic-classification`)
- ✅ **Command-line tool for easy use**
- ✅ **Integrate with Scikit-Learn / Imbalanced-Learn**
